# Building-Safety/Warning-Device Prototype using Arduino
Established project goals:
1. *Design an Arduino prototype demonstrating working sensors and code;*
2. *design a CAD model of the Shell/device housing that could be 3D printed by the manufacturer.*

Due to budget issues, and concerns for sending physical designs across the country through the mail during the COVID19 pandemic. Our team would build the Arduino prototype in Colorado Springs, CO and develop a detailed plan to be followed:

- Creating a schematic design for the client's invention which would allow him to easily
recreate the product himself. 
- This client's design can be given to a company to be mass manufactured for sale. The schematic design will include the
inner circuits of the product as well as a 3D model of the shell.
- Building and designing a working prototype using Arduino Genuino Uno parts, as well as
parts sourced from online resources. This prototype model will help both the client and potential
stakeholders understand how the device works.
- Providing a detailed document including prototype specifications, parts
used, and setup instructions utilizing similar inexpensive materials.

## Overview
A trigger upon detection of motion through a PIR sensor, which transmits an visual/audible alert. `PIR_sensor_test.ino` validates successful operation of the PIR sensor.
